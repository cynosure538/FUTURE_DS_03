# 🎓 Task 3 – College Event Feedback Analysis

This project is part of my **Data Analytics Internship at Future Interns**, where I explored real-world survey data from a student event and used data science to provide improvement suggestions.

---

## 📌 Objective

Analyze student event feedback collected via Google Forms to:
- Understand overall satisfaction using rating scales (1–5)
- Analyze sentiment of comments (positive/neutral/negative)
- Visualize feedback patterns
- Suggest improvements for future events

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Google Colab**
- **pandas** for data manipulation
- **TextBlob / VADER** for sentiment analysis
- **matplotlib / seaborn** for visualization
- **CSV Export from Google Forms**

---

## ✅ What I Did

- Cleaned and prepared feedback data
- Calculated average rating and categorized satisfaction
- Applied **NLP** (Natural Language Processing) to analyze textual comments
- Built charts to show trends in ratings and sentiment
- Created a summary report of key insights and recommendations

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Majority of students rated the event 4 or above
- Sentiment analysis showed 70% of comments were positive
- Identified top reasons for negative feedback (e.g., long wait times)
- Recommended improvements like better time management and more interaction

## 📊 Sample Visualizations

> *[Attach sentiment chart, rating histogram, and category-wise feedback chart]*

---

## 📎 File Included

- `student_feedback.csv` – raw survey data
- `event_feedback_analysis.ipynb` – full notebook
- `output_visuals/` – charts and sentiment results

---

## 🏁 Outcome

This project helped me apply data science to **human-centric feedback**, developing my skills in:
- Survey data analysis
- Text sentiment classification
- Visual storytelling with feedback data
